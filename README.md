# Roblox-assets-extractor
This tool is to extract cached data from your roblox installation. It does this by looking through the headers of cached files<br>
This is all in one script, the other files are not required
## Usage
Simply run the python script. The requirements would be downloaded via pip automatically.<br>
If the requirements do not download automatically, check your permissions, install it yourself (tkinter, requests), or [open an issue](https://github.com/AeEn123/Roblox-assets-extractor/issues/new/choose)
## More info
I am very new to tkinter so please note that the UI does look a bit messy<br>
Note: This is made for Windows and will not work for any other operating systems <br>
