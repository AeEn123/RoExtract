# Roblox Assets Extractor
This tool is designed to extract cached data from your Roblox installation by inspecting the headers of cached files.

This script is an all-in-one solution; additional files are not required.

## Requirements
- **Tkinter:** Tkinter is required to run this tool. On Windows, ensure that Tkinter is selected during the Python installation, or you can install it via pip. On Linux, you can install it using your package manager or download it via pip.
  To install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install tkinter
  ```
- *(Optional)* **Pip:** Pip can be used for auto-downloading modules. On Windows, ensure that the corresponding option is checked during the Python installation. On Linux, you can install it using your package manager.
- *(Optional)* **Requests:** This will be downloaded automatically via pip (with your consent) for the ability to check for updates. If automatic download fails, you can install it through pip:
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

## Usage
You can extract Roblox music, sounds, and textures from your Roblox cache (ensure your client is open for music).

Use the "Delete All" button to clear the currently selected cache folder. This is useful for extracting assets from a specific game.

If file listing becomes too slow, consider clearing your Roblox cache. You can do this by navigating to your cache folder (usually %Temp%\Roblox) and deleting all the files.

## More Info
I am relatively new to Tkinter, so please be aware that the UI may appear a bit messy.

**Note:** This tool is designed for Windows and Linux and may not work on other operating systems.
